Use compile.sh to compile the program. After compilation a file called "my_tracker"
will appear in current directory and that is the program executable.

There is an extra script provided called "run_all_tests.sh". This file runs the diff
command for all the student provided tests. You may run this script after a sucessfull
compilation.
